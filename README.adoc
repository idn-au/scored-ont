The thing being scored is the generic `dcat:Resource` which means anything catalogued according to DCAT could have a score indicated with the `scores:hasScore` property. Note also that scores in this model, which are `qb:ObservationCollection` instances, can indicate the thing they are a score for by using a `scores:refResource` property.
